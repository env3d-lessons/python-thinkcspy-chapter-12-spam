# SPAM Analysis

Original dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset 

This is an exercise on a field called data analysis, where we use python to process and
gather various statistics on a text file containing text messages that is marked
either SPAM or HAM (HAM meaning not spam)

The `spam.txt` file contains real text messages from various sources.  The first word
of each line specifies if the message is either "spam" or "ham" (once again, 
"ham" means it's a text message between real people).

All the questions asked you to analyze the spam.txt file, but during development, you 
may want to use spam_mini.txt so you can test your functions better.

# Questions

Read the comments from each of the functions in `main.py` and implement the
functions to answer the questions.  

# Running the code

To run the code, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will run the included user inteface that you can opened in your browser at
via the "PORTS" tab.  You can run each of the function in the user interface.

# Testing the code

Run `pytest` to test the code.

# Submitting the code

If you are satisfied with your code, you can submit it by running:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m 'Submit'
git push
```
